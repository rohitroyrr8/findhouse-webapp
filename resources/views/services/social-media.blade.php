                    Political advertising on social media has been a significant change for campaigns, candidates, and the public discourse. In the year 2014, Indian politics too witnessed the role of social media. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and WhatsApp are some of the most popular social media channels to reach the target audience in India.

                    Instead of using social media to meet their voters and create a dialogue, the parties use the media as a channel of advertising and promotions. The idea is simple, to get the message out and let one’s followers do the work of spreading and liking it. They create campaign strategies that align with the current issues and target their audience. If a post has a great impact, it can be re-used and emphasized again and thus give the senders great publicity without actually doing a great deal themselves.
